											<h3>Banquet </h3>

										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="/images-twenty-main/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>After a long exhilarating season, our team held our banquet at Huntington beach on May 26th, 2025, where we held out near a campsite. Our members built sand castles, went boogie boarding, and interacted 
											in many team activities, like a test between the 3 captains on the events and members of the team. The captains for 2025 elected the captains for 2026, which was revealed at the end of the 
											night to be Rylan Chau(11), Mathew Kong(12), and Ethan Deng(12)!
